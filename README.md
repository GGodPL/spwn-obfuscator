# spwn-obfuscator
 This obfuscator must be only used for educational purposes and not for obfuscating anything important that will be released!

 ## use
 the one and only macro in this library is `obfuscate()` and it can be used like this:
 `obfuscator.obfuscate(inp: @string, use_random_variable_names: @bool = true)`
 and it returns a valid spwn script as a string which should run the same as the input.
